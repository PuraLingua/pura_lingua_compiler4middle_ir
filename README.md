# PuraLingua Compiler for MiddleIR

## A Compiler that compiles IR to Puralingua bytecode.
It may *not* support all the instructions that Puralingua supports.
If you want to map txt to .plb file directly, you should try [SimpleIR](https://github.com/PuraLingua/pura_lingua_compiler4simple_ir).

Compared with SimpleIR, code written in it is more readable.

Lots of the code is copied from [SimpleIR](https://github.com/PuraLingua/pura_lingua_compiler4simple_ir).
