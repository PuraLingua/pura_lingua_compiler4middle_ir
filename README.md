# PuraLingua Compiler for MiddleIR

## A Compiler that compiles IR to Puralingua bytecode.
It may *not* support all the instructions that Puralingua supports.
If you want to map txt to .plb file directly, you should try [SimpleIR].

Compared with [SimpleIR], code written in it is more readable.

Lots of the code is copied from [SimpleIR].
